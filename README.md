"# S.A.S.S.Y. - Sentient Automated Sarcasm & Snark Yielder" 
# 🤖 S.A.S.S.Y. — Sentient Automated Sarcasm & Snark Yielder  
*(Not actually sentient… just Python pretending very convincingly.)*

---

## 💡 What is S.A.S.S.Y.?
S.A.S.S.Y. is a completely pointless Python program that acts like it’s self-aware.  
Its mission? To interrupt your day with popups, sarcastic voice comments, and milestone celebrations that mean absolutely nothing.

---

## 🧠 How it Works
It’s **not** AI. It’s not even smart. It’s just:
- `psutil` to stalk your CPU usage every 10 seconds.
- `pyttsx3` to read out snarky comments in a robotic voice.
- `tkinter` or `PySimpleGUI` to show popups you never wanted.
- `pynput` to spy on your clicks and key presses.

Basically: Python + libraries + sarcasm = chaos.

- **Voice Commentary** — Popups are *spoken aloud* so ignoring them is impossible.
- **Zero Practical Use** — Exactly as advertised.
