# 🤖 S.A.S.S.Y. — Sentient Automated Sarcasm & Snark Yielder  
*(Not actually sentient… just Python pretending very convincingly.)*

---

## 💡 What is S.A.S.S.Y.?
S.A.S.S.Y. is a completely pointless Python program that acts like it’s self-aware.  
Its mission? To interrupt your day with popups, sarcastic voice comments, and milestone celebrations that mean absolutely nothing.

---

## 🧠 How it Works
It’s **not** AI. It’s not even smart. It’s just:
- `psutil` to stalk your CPU usage every 10 seconds.
- `pyttsx3` to read out snarky comments in a robotic voice.
- `tkinter` or `PySimpleGUI` to show popups you never wanted.
- `pynput` to spy on your clicks and key presses.

Basically: Python + libraries + sarcasm = chaos.

---

## 🔥 Features
- **10-Second CPU Reports** — “Your CPU is loafing around again.”
- **Milestone Mouse Clicks** — Celebrations for 10, 20, 30… clicks nobody cares about.
- **Keyboard Input Tracking** — Every key press is a chance for more sass.
- **Voice Commentary** — Popups are *spoken aloud* so ignoring them is impossible.
- **Zero Practical Use** — Exactly as advertised.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `psutil`
- `pyttsx3`
- `tkinter` / `PySimpleGUI`
- `pynput`

Install them:
```bash
pip install psutil pyttsx3 pynput PySimpleGUI
```
## 🛠 Installation
- Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shyma22/useless_proj.git

cd useless_proj
```
- Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```
## 🏆 Sample Snark
- “10 clicks? I hope you’re proud of yourself.”
- “CPU at 15%. Just like your effort.”
- “You pressed ‘Enter’? Groundbreaking.”

## ❓ Why Is This Useless?
Because it exists purely to annoy you.

This “Sassy Sentient System”:
- Pops up **random, sarcastic, or pointless messages** every 10 seconds based on your CPU usage — whether you care or not.
- Tracks your mouse clicks and celebrates “milestones” like **10 clicks, 20 clicks, 50 clicks**… as if anyone asked.
- Reacts to every key press with popups that praise you for hitting *literally any key*.
- Reads the sass aloud using `pyttsx3` because *reading silently is too mainstream*.

It doesn’t improve performance.  
It doesn’t solve problems.  
It’s just a needy little program desperate for your attention.
